Harvard Softworks HS/FORTH makes full use of extended memory, and comes with optimizer, sound, graphics, and 80x87 libraries. 
Has an odd, but efficient, use of memory and dictionary structure.

The creator of Hs/Forth, the late Jim Kalihan never made the jump to the internet with this product.
Jim had his own ideas about naming Forth words that were different than many other Forths at the time.
I have created a repository of files that move Hs/Forth closer to ANS compliance, but not completely.
However it does fix some of the big differences and also provides some library code that I used in 
the 1990s to create applications.  The new HSF2012.EXE console provides some features that I liked from
FPC by Tom Zimmer. (color coded WORDS, command line input and more)
